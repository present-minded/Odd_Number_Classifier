Odd Even Classifier

A simple, interactive Command Line Interface tool built with Python that determines whether a given number is Even or Odd.


📝 Description
The Odd Even Classifier runs a continuous loop allowing the user to input integers. It performs a modulus operation to check the parity of the number. It includes error handling for non-numeric inputs and a clean exit strategy.

✨ Features
Instant Classification: Immediately identifies if a number is Even or Odd.
Input Validation: Gracefully handles errors if the user inputs text or special characters instead of a whole number.
Interactive Loop: Allows checking multiple numbers in a single session without restarting the program.
Exit Command: Type exit to close the program.
